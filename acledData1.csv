The residents tried to fend off the demolition team, accompanied by the police and security guards, by throwing bottles and rocks and setting tires on fire on the road. Meanwhile, some armed members of the demolition team opened fire while attempting to go through the fences. Two reporters were also threatened by armed members of the demolition team while covering the demolition. One of the reporters said that the armed individuals threatened to shoot her when she did not stop taking videos. The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said that the other reporter was held at gunpoint and her belongings were taken. The human rights group Karapatan stated that the company that ordered the demolition was trying to acquire the landholding previously granted to farmers under the government's agrarian reform program. Despite the farmers completing the necessary amortization payments," the Department of Agrarian Reform later invalidated the Certificate of Land Ownership Award given to them.
